This project is a backend for website with quiz. How to work with this project on side of the backend and values from database will be described below. 

## Attention!
Since this repository contains a backend part of this project, you can not find here any files of frontend part, but you can create your own, I will only be glad for this :)
This repo includes all the project files, along with Maven files, so that readers have an understanding of what I worked with when creating this project.    
All explanation of this code provided in the code comments for each function and each class.
